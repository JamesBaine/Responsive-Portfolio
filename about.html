      <p>Hi, my name James Baine and I am a wannabe web developer. I graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2014 with a BA in Global Studies but I still to this day have not figured out what I’m supposed to do with that degree. After college I went in a different direction and started working at Paramount Recording as a runner with the plan to learn all I can about sound engineering and hopefully make a career out of it. It was an awesome job, I got to meet a lot of well-known musicians and I got a lot of interesting stories out of it but I ultimately decided the music industry wasn’t really for me and that’s when I started to dabble with coding.</p>

      
      <p>I'm now fully totally to committed to starting a career in web/software development. I’m very excited about all the creative possibilities in this line of work. It’s also just a super useful skill you can basically apply to anything and the fact that I’m going into the one of the fasting growing industries out there is just the icing on the cake. Overall, I’m super stoked on what the future holds for me! </p>
